Question 34)
You have created an applet that draws lines. You have overriden the paint operation and
used the graphics drawLine method, and increase one of its parameters to multiple lines
across the screen. When you first test the applet you find that the news lines are redrawn,
but the old lines are erased. How can you modify your code to allow the old lines to stay
on the screen instead of being cleared.

1) Override repaint thus
public void repaint(Graphics g){
 	paint(g); 
 }
2)Override update thus
public void update(Graphics g) {
 	paint(g);
 }
3) turn off clearing with the method setClear();
4) Remove the drawing from the paint Method and place in the calling code
