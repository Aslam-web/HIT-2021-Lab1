//Question 39)

//If you create a TextField with a constructor to set it to occupy 5 columns, what difference
//will it make if you use it with a proportional font (ie Times Roman) or a fixed pitch
//typewriter style font (Courier).
//1)With a fixed font you will see 5 characters, with a proportional it will depend on the
//width of the characters
//2)With a fixed font you will see 5 characters,with a proportional it will cause the field to
//expand to fit the text
//3)The columns setting does not affect the number of characters displayed
//4)Both will show exactly 5 characters

// Answer
// 1)With a fixed font you will see 5 characters, with a proportional it will depend on the width of the characters
