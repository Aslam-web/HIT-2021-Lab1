//Question 22)

//If g is a graphics instance what will the following code draw on the screen?.
//g.fillArc(45,90,50,50,90,180);
//1) An arc bounded by a box of height 45, width 90 with a centre point of 50,50, starting
//at an angle of 90 degrees traversing through 180 degrees counter clockwise.
//2) An arc bounded by a box of height 50, width 50, with a centre point of 45,90 starting
//at an angle of 90 degrees traversing through 180 degrees clockwise.
//3) An arc bounded by a box of height 50, width 50, with a top left at coordinates of 45,
//90, starting at 90 degrees and traversing through 180 degrees counter clockwise.
//4) An arc starting at 45 degrees, traversing through 90 degrees clockwise bounded by a
//box of height 50, width 50 with a centre point of 90, 180. 

// Answer
// 3) An arc bounded by a box of height 50, width 50, with a top left at coordinates of 45,
// 	90, starting at 90 degrees and traversing through 180 degrees counter clockwise.
