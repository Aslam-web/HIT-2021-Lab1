Question 52)

You want to lay out a set of buttons horizontally but with more space between the first
button and the rest. You are going to use the GridBagLayout manager to control the way
the buttons are set out. How will you modify the way the GridBagLayout acts in order to
change the spacing around the first button?
1) Create an instance of the GridBagConstraints class, call the weightx() method and then
pass the GridBagConstraints instance with the component to the setConstraints method of
the GridBagLayout class.
2) Create an instance of the GridBagConstraints class, set the weightx field and then pass
the GridBagConstraints instance with the component to the setConstraints method of the
GridBagLayout class.
3) Create an instance of the GridBagLayout class, set the weightx field and then call the
setConstraints method of the GridBagLayoutClass with the component as a parameter.
4) Create an instance of the GridBagLayout class, call the setWeightx() method and then
pass the GridBagConstraints instance with the component to the setConstraints method of
the GridBagLayout class

Answer
